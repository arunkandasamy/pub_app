        %i "We use FormHub to run surveys in many African countries and needed a better way to visualise all the data from these surveys. With JARVIS:BI's FormHub dashboard, survey results can now be viewed in real time. This allows for immediate feedback about our programs from the field, which greatly increases the quality of the work we do."
